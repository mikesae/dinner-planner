# About

Plan your weekly dinner menu with this app.

## Nature of the Application

This is a web app that runs and looks great on most mobile devices (iPhones, iPads, Android devices, etc). It is also responsive enough to run and look great on a desktop browser.

## Stack

React with TypeScript and Sass with design tokens for color  
GraphQL (not REST) service interface to AWS DynamoDB  
Images stored in AWS S3, accessed in app via AWS Cloudfront

## Environment

This project was built for and is hosted on AWS amplify, Amazon's cloud-based development platform. Simply click on the link in the About Section (top right of github page) in a mobile browser and you can download it right to your device. On iPhones/iPads, it'll get its own icon on your homescreen, and you launch it just like you would a native applications. See [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS) for how to do this.
