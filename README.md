# About

Plan your weekly dinner menu with this app.

## Nature of the Application

This is web app that runs and looks great on most mobile devices (iPhones, iPads, Android devices, etc). It is also responsive enough to run and look great on a desktop browser.

## Environment

This project was built for and is hosted on AWS amplify, Amazon's cloud-based development platform. Simply click on the link in the About Section (top right of github page) in a mobile browser and you can download it right to your device. On iPhones/iPads, it'll get it's own icon on your homescreen, and you launch it just like you would a native applications. See [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS) for how to do this.
